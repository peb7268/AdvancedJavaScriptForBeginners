# TDD: Test Driven Development
There are two most popular tools used in TDD today: `jest` for unit testing and `cypress` for integration testing.
Cypress is a successor to selenium. 

> Package.json not only manages dependencies, but also can run scripts and hold general configurations for your project.

**Integration Testing:** Aka, end-to-end testing (E2E) interacting with the browser as if it were a real person, testing various things out. (cypress)
**Unit Testing**: Aka black box testing, tests units of code. Makes sure each function / object works as expected. (jest)


## Agenda
- move browser-sync config to a better place
- [x] move racing app into docker
- [] put in TDD in the racting app
    - jest
    - cypress
- [] work with me on my work testing
