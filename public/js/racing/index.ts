/**
 * Homework: 
 * Alone: 
 * 1. Create subclasses from the Car class
 * 2. Confirm all exports and imports work afterwards.
 * 3. Define default, common methods and attributes, that all cars should have in the parent class.
 * 4. Each car's dependencies ( engine:object, tires, ect.. ) should be injectible through the constructor.
 *      - required properties: type (car type)
 * 
 * Together: 
 * - We will create a velocity method to determine how fast each car goes
 * - We will start the race and race each car
