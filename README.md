# Advanced JavaScript For Beginners
This course we will be focusing on coding best practices, tooling, workflows, and understanding "advanced coding" techniques for modern JavaScript development.

A large part of the complexity of learning "professional programming" patterns is setting up the tooling. As we study this course, you will be given a complete setup starting out. It consists of:

- **Docker** for your environment
- **Webpack** to bundle and build assets
- **Typescript** for modern JavaScript practices
- **Jest** for unit testing
- **Cypress** for integration testing
- **Sass** for CSS preprocessing
- **NPM** as our package manager but also as a build tool

The focus of this course will not be on learning tooling per-se, although we can cover these things in more detail as we go if you would like. Rather, we will be focused on the usage of these tools, why they are good to use, how day to day usage makes for good development workflow.


## The Project
We will be building a racing simulator. We will make a racetrack, cars, engine, ect.. out of object oriented design principles. We will then render those to a track in the browser, and watch the cards race.

At the end of the class, we will conclude by having a racing competition. You build your car classes / objects out of a set of rules we will decide on up front. As long as your code adheres to the common loose guidelines we put in place, you can build anything you want into your car.

### Agenda
1. Day One: The Build System and Your First Tests
2. Basic system design: Which classes we'll need, getting started. Imperative Vs Declarative programming, reactive programming.
3. **SOLID** Design Principles: The Single Responsibility principle
4. **SOLID** Design Principles: The Open Closed principle
5. **SOLID** Design Principles: Liskov Substitution principle
6. **SOLID** Design Principles: Interface Segregation principle
7. **SOLID** Design Principles: Dependency Inversion
8. The Observer Pattern
9. The Factory Pattern / Module Revealing Pattern
10. The Command Pattern
